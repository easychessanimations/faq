<p>What engine does easychess use?</p>

Easychess uses single threaded Stockfish WASM for a bot engine. You cannot expect it to be upgraded to latest Stockfish, because the goal is not performance. For perforamnce install lichess-bot and use a native engine.

<p>My bot does not move</p>

Try to log out then log in again with lichess bot, so that your access token is refreshed.

<p>How do I make my rating unprovisional ( remove question mark beside rating )?</p>
